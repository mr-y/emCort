emCort.pl is a perl script to download sequences associated to Cortinarius from emerencia. The association can be either throug annotation if this annotation is a full species name or by BLAST match against such sequence. If you want the script to download sequences of any other genus you must make changes in the script (see comments in the script). It is also easy to alter the script to use BLAST matches based only on ITS2 and to only download eithe IIS or FIS (see comments in script).

The main reasons to use this script rather than emerencia.org is that it can add sequences to an already existing file (just put it in updated.fst) and that it gives you a file with new sequences not previously in that file. The script connects to emerencia using the emerencia web interface so an internett connection is nessesary.
